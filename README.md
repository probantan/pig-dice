## Description
{The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.

 In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. 
Each result get added to his ROUND score

BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. 
After that, it's the next player's turn

-The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND 
score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, 
it's the next player's turn

 The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game }
